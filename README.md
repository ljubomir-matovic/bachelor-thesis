# Distributed hyperparameter optimization

In my recent project, I leveraged a powerful combination of Optuna, Dask, and Kubernetes to perform distributed hyperparameter optimization, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of our model training process.

**Optuna** is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework that allows us to automate the search for the best hyperparameters for our machine learning models. With its advanced features such as automated pruning of unpromising trials and a user-friendly API, Optuna simplifies the complex task of hyperparameter tuning.

**Dask** is a flexible parallel computing library in Python that enables us to scale our computations across multiple cores or machines. By integrating Dask with Optuna, we were able to distribute the hyperparameter optimization tasks across a cluster, significantly reducing the time required to explore the hyperparameter space.

**Kubernetes** played a crucial role in managing and orchestrating our distributed computing environment. It provided the infrastructure to deploy and scale our Dask cluster efficiently. With Kubernetes, we could easily manage resources, monitor workloads, and ensure high availability of our computing nodes.

## Implementation Overview

1. Setting Up Optuna: I started by defining my objective function and search space for hyperparameters using Optuna.

2. Integrating Dask: I then configured Dask to parallelize the evaluation of hyperparameter trials. By utilizing Dask's distributed scheduler, I ensured that each trial could run concurrently across multiple workers, leading to faster exploration of the hyperparameter space.

3. Deploying with Kubernetes: To handle the distributed workload, I deployed my Dask cluster on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes facilitated the dynamic scaling of resources based on the workload, allowing me to efficiently manage and optimize my computational resources. You can see [here](./deployment.md) how I did deployment of Dask cluster on Kubernetes cluster.

## Results and Benefits

The integration of Optuna, Dask, and Kubernetes resulted in a highly efficient hyperparameter optimization workflow. I achieved faster convergence to optimal hyperparameters due to the parallel processing capabilities of Dask and the scalability provided by Kubernetes. This setup not only reduced the time required for hyperparameter tuning but also allowed us to handle larger datasets and more complex models effectively.

## Summary

In summary, combining Optuna for hyperparameter optimization with Dask for parallel computation and Kubernetes for orchestration provided a robust solution for distributed hyperparameter optimization, greatly enhancing the performance and scalability of our machine learning pipelines.
