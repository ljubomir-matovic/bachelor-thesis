# Distributed hyperparameter optimization

In my recent project, I leveraged a powerful combination of Optuna, Dask, and Kubernetes to perform distributed hyperparameter optimization, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of our model training process.

**Optuna** is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework that allows us to automate the search for the best hyperparameters for our machine learning models. With its advanced features such as automated pruning of unpromising trials and a user-friendly API, Optuna simplifies the complex task of hyperparameter tuning.

**Dask** is a flexible parallel computing library in Python that enables us to scale our computations across multiple cores or machines. By integrating Dask with Optuna, we were able to distribute the hyperparameter optimization tasks across a cluster, significantly reducing the time required to explore the hyperparameter space.

**Kubernetes** played a crucial role in managing and orchestrating our distributed computing environment. It provided the infrastructure to deploy and scale our Dask cluster efficiently. With Kubernetes, we could easily manage resources, monitor workloads, and ensure high availability of our computing nodes.

## Implementation Overview

1. Setting Up Optuna: I started by defining my objective function and search space for hyperparameters using Optuna.

2. Integrating Dask: I then configured Dask to parallelize the evaluation of hyperparameter trials. By utilizing Dask's distributed scheduler, I ensured that each trial could run concurrently across multiple workers, leading to faster exploration of the hyperparameter space.

3. Deploying with Kubernetes: To handle the distributed workload, I deployed my Dask cluster on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes facilitated the dynamic scaling of resources based on the workload, allowing me to efficiently manage and optimize my computational resources. You can see [here](./deployment.md) how I did deployment of Dask cluster on Kubernetes cluster.

## Implementation in Python

In `/scripts` you can see Jupyter notebooks for Titanic and Brazil house rent problems. I solved the problems serially and in parallel.

### Titanic

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes like age, gender, class, and whether they survived the tragic sinking. This dataset is often used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the available features.

In this classification problem, a **DecisionTreeClassifier** can be employed to model the relationship between the passengers' features and their survival outcome. Decision trees work by splitting the data into branches based on feature values, ultimately leading to a decision about the class label (in this case, survival). The interpretability of decision trees makes them a popular choice for this type of problem, allowing us to easily understand the factors that influenced the survival predictions.

When using a **DecisionTreeClassifier** in machine learning, hyperparameters play a crucial role in controlling the behavior of the model and its performance. Here are some of the key hyperparameters for a DecisionTreeClassifier:

1. **`max_depth`**: This hyperparameter defines the maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth helps to prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting to the training data. A shallow tree might underfit, missing important patterns, while a very deep tree might overfit, capturing noise in the training data.

2. **`min_samples_leaf`**: This sets the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A higher value can lead to a more generalized model by preventing the creation of leaf nodes with very few samples, which might represent outliers.

### Brazil house rent

The Brazil House Rent dataset provides detailed information on rental properties across various cities in Brazil. It includes features such as the number of rooms, location, property type, and amenities, alongside the rental price. This dataset is commonly used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict the rental price of a property based on these features.

In this context, the **RandomForestRegressor** is an effective model for predicting house rents. This algorithm builds multiple decision trees during training and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting. By considering multiple trees, the RandomForestRegressor can capture complex patterns in the data, making it well-suited for predicting continuous values like rent prices. Its ability to handle a large number of features and its robustness to overfitting make it a popular choice for regression tasks involving real estate data.

The **RandomForestRegressor** is a powerful and flexible machine learning model used for regression tasks, particularly when dealing with complex datasets. Its performance and behavior can be fine-tuned through various hyperparameters. Below are some of the key hyperparameters for a RandomForestRegressor:

1. **`n_estimators`**: This hyperparameter specifies the number of decision trees in the forest. A larger number of trees generally improves the model's performance but increases computational cost. The default is often sufficient, but increasing it can lead to better predictions, especially for large datasets.

2. **`max_depth`**: This limits the maximum depth of each tree in the forest. By constraining the depth, you can prevent the individual trees from becoming too complex and overfitting the data. However, setting it too low might lead to underfitting.

3. **`min_samples_split`**: This defines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A higher value prevents the model from splitting too frequently on small data patterns, which can reduce overfitting.

## Results and Benefits

The integration of Optuna, Dask, and Kubernetes resulted in a highly efficient hyperparameter optimization workflow. I achieved faster convergence to optimal hyperparameters due to the parallel processing capabilities of Dask and the scalability provided by Kubernetes. This setup not only reduced the time required for hyperparameter tuning but also allowed us to handle larger datasets and more complex models effectively.

## Summary

In summary, combining Optuna for hyperparameter optimization with Dask for parallel computation and Kubernetes for orchestration provided a robust solution for distributed hyperparameter optimization, greatly enhancing the performance and scalability of our machine learning pipelines.
